# ðŸ•µ Operation: Dark Horse

**Operation: Dark Horse** is a modular cybersecurity toolkit for network reconnaissance, stealth scanning, and early threat detection.  
Designed for ethical hacking and defensive security training in controlled lab environments, it automates reconnaissance and scanning workflows to save time while maintaining stealth.

---

## ðŸš€ Features
- **Stealth Reconnaissance** â€“ Slow, randomized scanning to evade detection.
- **Automated Enumeration** â€“ Gathers service, port, and OS information.
- **Modular Scripts** â€“ Easily integrate with existing security workflows.
- **Multi-Tool Integration** â€“ Works alongside tools like Nmap, `arp-scan`, and `whois`.
- **Logging & Reporting** â€“ Saves results in structured formats for later analysis.

---

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used
- **Python 3.x**
- **Bash Scripting**
- **Nmap**, `arp-scan`, `netcat`, `whois`
- Linux/Unix-based environments

---

## ðŸ“– How It Works
1. **Select Scan Mode** â€“ Choose between stealth, aggressive, or targeted scanning.
2. **Run Recon** â€“ The tool collects network and device information using integrated utilities.
3. **Store Results** â€“ Outputs data in JSON or plain text for reporting.
4. **Review & Act** â€“ Use the findings for defensive hardening or further ethical testing.

## ðŸ§  Example Usage
```bash
python darkhorse.py --mode stealth --target 192.168.1.0/24
```
**Example Output:**
```
[+] Running Stealth Scan on 192.168.1.0/24
[+] Found Host: 192.168.1.15 - Port 22/tcp (Open)
[+] Found Host: 192.168.1.20 - Port 80/tcp (Open)
[+] Results saved to /logs/darkhorse_report.json
```
